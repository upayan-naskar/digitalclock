# Digital Clock
Hey there I am Upayan Naskar and I have brought a new project "A Digital Clock".

Actually it is a very basic project.

I have used normal pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project.

THis project may be a refresher for your CSS skills.

In CSS we have used a number of media queries.

We have added a background image and it changes with respect to the kind of the device i.e laptop, mobile or tablet.

Hope you will like this project.

Thank you for reading till the end.
